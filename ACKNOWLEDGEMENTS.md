# Acknowledgements

Mappadux ships with a built-in attribution system. Every audio and map
asset in the GM's library carries its licence, creator, and source URL,
and **Copy attributions** in the asset library generates a ready-to-paste
credits block. The list below is the same output for the assets bundled
with the default *Getting Started* pack — practising what we preach.

## Contributors

Community members who've contributed code, with thanks:

- **[Naturalitee](https://github.com/Naturalitee)** — GM main-area UI fixes: input-styling consistency, projection-picker overflow, and settings-section scroll (v2.17.24); keeping the Player-view PiP on-screen when the viewport resizes, and syncing the player-view rect on zoom (v2.17.39).

The motion-tracker ping sounds (`MT-ping.mp3` / `MT-return.mp3`)
distributed as static files in `src/assets/` are Balcoran's CC0
samples — trimmed and level-adjusted for use in the motion-tracker
system. CC0 doesn't require attribution but giving credit is good
etiquette.

## Soundtracks Engines *(v2.16)*

The Soundtracks panel multiplexes two third-party playback engines
behind one slot UI. Both are loaded lazily — a pack that doesn't
use Soundtracks never pulls either script.

| Provider | Script | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **YouTube IFrame Player API** | `https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api` | Used under YouTube's [API Services Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service). No API key needed; the embed plays through YouTube's own IFrame. Mappadux drives play / pause / seek / volume programmatically. |
| **Spotify Web Playback SDK** | `https://sdk.scdn.co/spotify-player.js` | Used under the [Spotify Developer Terms of Service](https://developer.spotify.com/terms/). Each user registers their own Spotify Developer App (PKCE OAuth, no Client Secret). Web Playback SDK requires a Spotify Premium account. Mappadux uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) for transport commands (play / pause / shuffle / repeat / device transfer) and the SDK for in-browser audio output. |

Tokens and credentials stay on the user's machine; they never
travel in `.mappadux` pack bundles or to any Mappadux server.

## UI Icons

The hamburger menu, library buttons, and other in-app icon affordances use
**Lucide** (https://lucide.dev), an MIT-licensed icon set originally forked
from Feather Icons. Individual path data is hand-extracted from the
`lucide-static` package and inlined as monochrome SVG so the icons follow
the current theme colour.

Lucide is also exposed at runtime in the **Small Assets Library**'s
"Browse Lucide" tab, where users can import individual icons into their
own packs. Imports carry the same MIT attribution string via the unified
asset-library credits modal.

## Image Asset Library Connectors *(v2.11)*

The Small Asset Library ships two built-in icon source connectors so users
can pull icons into their packs without leaving the app. Both flow proper
per-asset attribution back through the unified credits modal whenever
an icon is used in a pack.

| Source | Licence | Asset count | Authors |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) | MIT | ~1,500 | Lucide contributors (forked from Feather Icons by Cole Bemis) |
| [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/) | [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) | ~4,000 | Lorc, Delapouite, Skoll, Quoting, and other contributors |

SVGs are served via jsDelivr from the upstream GitHub repositories at use
time; the bundled manifests carry name, slug, and author metadata only,
not the SVG bytes.

### MIT-licensed shaders

The MapFX *Ocean* effect's shader is adapted from work by **afl_ext (2017-2024)**,
distributed under the [MIT licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

| Effect | Name | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| Ocean | Ocean / open-sea waves (afl_ext) | Shadertoy (see source comment) |

Modifications made to afl_ext's ocean shader:
- Replaced the mouse-rotated 3D camera + ray-march of two water planes with a fixed top-down view; each shader-plane pixel samples the surface directly via `vUv` mapped to wave-space.
- Dropped the sky-only branch (top-down can't see horizon).
- Reduced `ITERATIONS_NORMAL` from 36 to 16; at battlemap altitude the micro-detail isn't visible and 36-iteration normals scale poorly when a large ocean polygon covers most of the screen.
- Kept the procedural atmosphere + sun + ACES tone-mapping intact — they're what give the original its plausible-daytime look.
- Removed the trailing `pow(.., 1/2.2)` sRGB encoding inside ACES; the renderer's `OutputPass` does sRGB encoding for the whole scene and keeping it in the shader would double-encode.
- Added per-poly uniforms: `uColor` (gentle 20% hue tint mixed in after tone-mapping), `uIntensity`, `uScale` (wave feature size, 0.25–4 — covers small bay through horizon-spanning ocean), `uSpeed` (0 = mirror-still through 4 = stormy). No direction slider — ocean swells are multi-directional in the wave-sum, not a single flow vector.



Modifications made to "Promethean":
- Translated from ShaderToy GLSL to Three.js ShaderMaterial / GLSL ES 1.00.
- Replaced `iTime` with `time`; kept the `iChannel0` noise texture purpose as `uNoise`.
- Replaced mouse-controlled camera (`iMouse`) with a slow time-driven auto-rotation so the orb keeps moving without user input.
- Per-polygon plane: each painted fire polygon owns its own plane sized to its bounding box, so the orb appears centred on the polygon rather than at the centre of the map.
- Added `uMask` (per-polygon alpha mask), `uColor` (polygon tint colour), `uIntensity` (0.05–1.5 output multiplier), `uScale` (0.25–4 procedural feature scale), and `uAspect` (plane width/height for non-square polygons).
- Removed the hard-coded warm palette inside `vmarch`; the orb now produces a luminance signal that is multiplicatively tinted by `uColor` at composite time, so the GM can paint red / blue / green / purple flames using the same shader.
- Output uses additive blending in the renderer's scene composite so the flame reads as glowing fire over the underlying map.

Modifications made to "A river" (Pierco fork):
- Reduced the 3D mouse-rotated camera + plane intersection to a fixed top-down view — Mappadux is a battlemap, not a scenic close-up. Each shader-plane pixel maps directly to a wave surface point via `vUv`.
- Replaced the `iChannel0` skybox cubemap with a procedural sky tint (no horizon visible top-down).
- `iChannel1` riverbed texture is the original Shadertoy asset (`bed.jpg` in the river folder). A planned future variant samples the underlying map texture instead so the GM's painted river bed shimmers through — generic `uMap` + `uMapUv` uniform support is in `shaderRegistry` ready for it, but the v1 shader uses the original bed texture so we can iterate on the wave / refraction math first.
- `iChannel2` wave noise is the original Shadertoy asset (`noise.jpg` in the river folder) — softer than our generic noise.png and gives the rolling-wavelet look the original was tuned for.
- Added per-poly uniforms: `uColor` (water hue tint), `uIntensity` (output multiplier), `uScale` (wave feature density), `uSpeed` (flow rate), `uDirection` (flow direction in radians, compass convention with 0 = north). Each is a slider in the GM panel.
- Output uses normal alpha blending (not additive) — a real river has a definite surface that obscures what's strictly under it, modulated by refraction. Additive would have just brightened the bed.

## Animated Backdrops

The animated backdrops that fill the letterbox / pillarbox bars
around the map. As of v2.12 every shareable MapFX kind also runs
as a backdrop via the same shader source — one fragment.glsl, two
rendering paths. Credits are inherited from the MapFX side; the
attributions listed here cover the dual-use cases.

| Backdrop | MapFX source kind | Author | Licence |
|----------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| Aurora | aurora | Mappadux original | — |
| Coloured Flames | fire | nimitz (2014) — see MapFX section above | CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 |
| Embers | embers | Mappadux original | — |
| Firestorm | firestorm | PrzemyslawZaworski (2019) — GLSL fragment ported, raymarch reduced from 128 to 48 steps | CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 |
| Magic Portal | portal | Delincoter (2021) — see MapFX section above | CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 |
| Magical Light | light | Mappadux original | — |
| Mist / Smoke | mist | deusnovus (2021) — see MapFX section above; `smooth_fog` backdrop id retired in v2.12, aliased to `mist` for backwards compat | CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 |
| Noise | noise | Mappadux original — TV-static, single hash per fragment | — |
| Ocean | ocean | afl_ext (2017-2024) — see MapFX section above | MIT |
| Starfield | starfield | Deadtotem (2020) — see MapFX section above | CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 |
| Thundercloud | thundercloud | mahalis (2019) — see MapFX section above; noise primitive by Inigo Quilez (MIT); hash helpers by David Hoskins (CC BY-SA 4.0) | CC BY-NC 4.0 |

Modifications shared by every backdrop port:
- Original MapFX shader's `void main()` keeps the polygon-mask shell. A `vec4 fxEffect(vec2 uv)` function below the helpers carries the visible algorithm. The backdrop wrapper (src/rendering/backdrops/fromMapFx.ts) lifts the marker-delimited block (uniforms + helpers + fxEffect) into the clip-pass and composites the result over `uBgColor` using the kind's blend mode (additive for 'screen' kinds, alpha-composite for 'normal' kinds).
- Texture passthrough (uNoise for Fire / Light, uBed for River) shares the MapFX shaderRegistry cache so loading happens once regardless of which subsystem mounts the shader first.

Backdrop-specific tweaks (where the port diverges from the MapFX behaviour or convention):
- Aurora / Embers — written in-house for Mappadux.
- Smooth Fog — same algorithm as the MapFX *Mist* effect (credited above), exposed here as a full-bars backdrop with GM-tunable fog colour, background, and density. `INTENSITY` and the two hardcoded colours promoted to uniforms; aspect-correct UV so cells don't squash on tall/wide bars.
- Firestorm — kept only the GLSL fragment from the Shadertoy entry (the surrounding C/HLSL DirectX 12 reference code is irrelevant for our use). Reduced the raymarch from 128 to 48 steps with a wider step length, exposed the hot-core + smoke colours and an overall intensity.

## Bundled Fonts *(Small Asset Library — Fonts category)*

The Small Asset Library ships twelve typefaces locally — woff2 bytes
included in the app bundle via the corresponding `@fontsource/*` npm
packages, precached by the PWA service worker on first load. Every
font is distributed under **SIL Open Font License 1.1**.
Self-hosting (rather than streaming from Google's CDN at runtime)
means Mappadux works fully offline at the table.

User-added fonts (the "Browse Google Fonts" path in the Small Asset
Library + uploaded woff2/ttf blobs) keep their existing pathways —
Google CDN for unknown families, FontFace API for uploaded bytes.
Only the twelve catalog families above are locally bundled.
