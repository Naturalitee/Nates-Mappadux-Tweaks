# Acknowledgements

Mappadux ships with a built-in attribution system. Every audio and map
asset in the GM's library carries its licence, creator, and source URL,
and **Copy attributions** in the asset library generates a ready-to-paste
credits block. The list below is the same output for the assets bundled
with the default *Getting Started* pack — practising what we preach.

The motion-tracker ping sounds (`MT-ping.mp3` / `MT-return.mp3`)
distributed as static files in `src/assets/` are Balcoran's CC0
samples — trimmed and level-adjusted for use in the motion-tracker
system. CC0 doesn't require attribution but giving credit is good
etiquette.

## UI Icons

The hamburger menu, library buttons, and other in-app icon affordances use
**Lucide** (https://lucide.dev), an MIT-licensed icon set originally forked
from Feather Icons. Individual path data is hand-extracted from the
`lucide-static` package and inlined as monochrome SVG so the icons follow
the current theme colour.

Lucide is also exposed at runtime in the **Small Assets Library**'s
"Browse Lucide" tab, where users can import individual icons into their
own packs. Imports carry the same MIT attribution string via the unified
asset-library credits modal.

## Image Asset Library Connectors *(v2.11)*

The Small Asset Library ships two built-in icon source connectors so users
can pull icons into their packs without leaving the app. Both flow proper
per-asset attribution back through the unified credits modal whenever
an icon is used in a pack.

| Source | Licence | Asset count | Authors |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) | MIT | ~1,500 | Lucide contributors (forked from Feather Icons by Cole Bemis) |
| [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/) | [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) | ~4,000 | Lorc, Delapouite, Skoll, Quoting, and other contributors |

SVGs are served via jsDelivr from the upstream GitHub repositories at use
time; the bundled manifests carry name, slug, and author metadata only,
not the SVG bytes.

## Visual Filters

Modifications made:
- Translated from ShaderToy GLSL to Three.js EffectComposer / GLSL ES 1.00
- Replaced `iChannel0` (video/image input) with `tDiffuse` (rendered scene texture)
- Replaced `iChannel1`/`iChannel2` (noise/paper textures) with procedural GLSL noise
- Replaced ShaderToy uniforms (`iResolution`, `iTime`) with equivalent Three.js uniforms
- Reduced iteration counts for real-time performance
- Exposed artistic parameters as user-adjustable sliders
