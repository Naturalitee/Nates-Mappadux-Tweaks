//   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md.
//
// Adaptation notes:
//   • The original is a 3/4 perspective close-up of a river plane with a
//     mouse-rotated camera and cubemap sky reflections. Mappadux is
//     top-down at high altitude, so the camera is reduced to a fixed
//     near-overhead view per pixel — vUv directly drives the wave
//     surface coordinate, no ray-marching needed.
//   • iChannel0 (cubemap reflections) → procedural sky tint. From a
//     near-top-down view there's no horizon worth simulating.
//   • iChannel1 (riverbed texture) → uBed, the original Shadertoy
//     bed.jpg (gem-pebbles look) loaded from the river folder. The
//     earlier attempt sampled uMap (the GM's painted art under the
//     polygon) but the result didn't read well — likely a UV / Y-flip
//     issue we'll come back to. uMap support stays in the registry
//     for future use; for now this shader uses the original texture
//     so we can confirm the wave / refraction math reads correctly.
//   • iChannel2 (wave noise) → uNoise (copied from the original
//     Shadertoy asset — softer organic blobs that give proper rolling
//     wavelets instead of the angular ripples our other shaders' noise
//     would produce).
//   • Per-poly uniforms: uColor (water hue tint), uIntensity (output
//     multiplier), uScale (wave feature density), uSpeed (flow rate),
//     uDirection (compass-radians, 0 = north). Per-poly mask: uMask.
