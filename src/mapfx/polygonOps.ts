/**
 * Polygon ops for the v2.12 unified overlay system.
 *
 * Wraps `polygon-clipping` (Martinez-Rueda) with the FogVertex[] shape used
 * everywhere else. Handles the GeoJSON-style nesting conversion in / out.
 *
 * The library represents polygons as `Polygon[]`, where each `Polygon` is
 * `[[ring0, ring1, ...]]` — ring0 is the outer ring, the rest are holes.
 * For our simple non-holed strokes we always emit `[[ring]]`.
 *
 * Difference returns 0 / 1 / N polygons depending on the split shape — the
 * caller replaces the original target with these in the polygons array.
