/**
 * Animated backdrops — rendered in the letterbox / pillarbox area of the
 * GM canvas (the bars left empty around the map rectangle). Each entry
 * provides a GLSL snippet that the Renderer's clip-pass injects into its
 * "outside the viewport" branch. Inside the viewport the clip pass
 * continues to pass the composed scene through untouched, so the map
 * itself is never overlaid by the backdrop — only dead bars are dressed.
 *
 * Snippet contract:
 *   • Receives the same fragment uniforms as the clip pass:
 *       uBgColor (vec3, linear),
 *       time     (float, seconds since renderer start),
 *       uSpeed   (float, GM-tuned scalar; defaults to 1.0),
 *       vUv      (varying, full-canvas 0..1 UV).
 *   • Must end with `gl_FragColor = vec4(<color>, 1.0);` — opaque output.
 *   • Should never `discard` (would leave a hole in the bars).
 *
 * Adding a new backdrop: create a sibling file exporting `id`, `label`,
 * and `fragment` strings, register it in BACKDROPS.
