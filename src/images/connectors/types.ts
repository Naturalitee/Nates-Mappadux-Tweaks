 * ImageSourceConnector — plug-in interface for external icon catalogs.

 *
 * v2.11 ships with two implementations:
 *   • Game Icons (game-icons.net) — CC-BY 3.0 medieval/fantasy/sci-fi SVGs
 *   • Lucide — MIT-licensed contemporary line icons
 *
 * Future connectors (Material Symbols, custom user URLs, etc.) plug in by
 * implementing this interface and registering with the modal.
 *
 * The pattern is catalog-based, not authentication-based: each connector
 * provides a manifest (bundled or fetched) describing what's available,
 * and a fetchSvg() method that pulls the actual SVG markup from the
 * source's CDN. No API key needed.
