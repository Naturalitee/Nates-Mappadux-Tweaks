  &nbsp;Mappadux — VTT@Home
</h1>

> Latin _mappa_ (cloth / signal banner / map) + _dux_ (leader / guide). Map guide. Also a duck on a map.

## Try It Now

**[https://www.mappadux.com/](https://www.mappadux.com/)**

No account needed. No server. Everything stays on your device — maps you upload are stored in your browser's local storage and never sent anywhere. Just open the link and go.

> **Heads-up:** Mappadux is under active, ongoing development, so you may run into the odd bug. If something's broken or annoying, please [pop onto the Discord](https://discord.gg/UAEq4zzjD8) and let me know — reporting it is the fastest way to get it fixed before it gets in the way of your game.

## Why Mappadux

**Hi, I'm Alex.** I wanted VTT features for the table I actually game at — players around real wood, a screen showing the map. I kept cobbling together half a dozen tools, and prep was eating most of my evening before anyone arrived. I wanted *one* thing: fast to set up, easy to use without breaking the flow of play. That's Mappadux.

### Any device on your LAN is a second screen

Mappadux connects the GM and players over peer-to-peer, so **any phone, tablet, or laptop on the same network is a fully functional second screen** — no HDMI cable, no DisplayLink dongle, no installed app. Open the QR code on the device, done.

> Pack your gaming laptop and two old tablets. The laptop is your GM screen. One tablet sits flat on the table at true 1″ scale as the projector view — your battlemap / floorplan. The other tablet faces the players for handouts, room descriptions, and reveals. That's a full three-screen VTT setup in a bag.

> **Pro tip — drive more screens at once.** Need the floorplan AND a handout up at the same time, on different tablets? Use the Hamburger → **Open New Instance** option *(new in v2.15)* — that spawns a fresh, independent Mappadux in a new tab with its own library and its own room code. To get your pack into both, **Save Map Pack…** from the first window, then **Load Map Pack** in the second one (or host it once and use `?bundle=<URL>` for instant load in both). Now you can run two GM windows side-by-side: one broadcasting the battlemap to the table tablet via its projector view, the other broadcasting a handout to a player tablet via its player view. Each room is independent, so the same pack can feed as many simultaneous views as you have devices.

### What it does

- **Sets up in minutes, not hours.** Add a map, set a scale, drop a few markers — you're ready.
- **Shows maps on any tablet / phone** for players, or **projects at true 1″ / 25 mm scale** onto an under-table screen or down-projector for in-person play.
- **Fog of war, painted shader effects, animated backdrops, markers, motion trackers, atmospheric audio, and visual filters** — without hunting through menus mid-scene.
- **Players join in** *(new in v2.17)* — named players with their own draggable tokens, map pings, two-way messaging, a fanned-deck initiative tracker, shared progress clocks / timers / notes, and optional LLM-assisted reply suggestions. Players stop being a passive audience.

It tries to feel **immersive** too: parchment / hand-drawn / CRT-phosphor filters, smooth map transitions, positional and motion-tracker audio.

And it's built to **share**. Whole packs — maps, audio, splash, theme — travel in a single `.mappadux` file (optionally encrypted), so a session you built can reach your players, your Patreon, or the wider community as easily as forwarding an email.

**Credit the creators.** Every map and sound in Mappadux carries its licence, source, and creator. The asset library has a *Copy attributions* action that produces a ready-to-paste credits block — please use it. The community that supplies free, high-quality assets only keeps going if we keep crediting it.

Players connect over peer-to-peer (PeerJS); no server infrastructure beyond static file hosting. Everything stays on your device.

## Features

- **Map library** — add `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp` images by upload, paste-by-URL, or pick from your existing library. One map image asset can back multiple named maps with their own fog / markers / audio / tracker config — handy for re-using the same battlemap across encounters. Hover for thumbnail preview, rename live, **Clone Map** for instant copies (image shared, settings duplicated independently). Missing or broken asset URLs render a placeholder so fog and marker positions stay sensible until you click **⚠ Fix Missing Map**.
- **Auto-scale on import** — Mappadux guesses each map's 1″ grid from filename hints (`[40x30]`), embedded image DPI (PNG `pHYs` / JPEG JFIF), and the greatest common factor of the image dimensions (assuming square cells). High-confidence detections apply silently and badge the map **Scaled** (yellow); best-guess matches badge **AutoScaled** (orange); ambiguous imports prompt a small radio dialog with the top candidates. Maps that have no grid (handouts, world maps, stat blocks) can be opted out with one toggle. Legacy packs get the same pass on load, so older bundles upgrade themselves automatically.
- **Fog of War + MapFX** *(unified in v2.12)* — draw arbitrary polygons with the kind dropdown choosing what each shape becomes:

  | Kind | Reads as |
  |---|---|
  | Fog of War | Opaque black hide-zones (the classic) |
  | Coloured Flames | Volumetric flame orb; GM-tinted (natural orange → soulfire blue / wisp-green / eldritch purple) |
  | Firestorm | Inferno of rising fire + smoke columns, GM-tunable hot core + smoke tints |
  | Embers | Parallax-layered rising sparks; tint for soulfire, magma, arcane sparks |
  | River | Flowing water with refracted bed; per-poly direction so every river bends differently |
  | Ocean | Top-down sea with sun glints + wave height (calm → stormy) |
  | Mist / Smoke | Drifting wisps with direction; cyber-smoke, swamp fog, sea fret |
  | Thundercloud | Cool slate body with random lightning flashes; GM picks the flash hue |
  | Magic Portal | Animated swirling event-horizon disc; portal hue tunable |
  | Magical Light | Radial glow + animated swirls + sparkle particles; pick the hue |
  | Aurora | Drifting horizontal curtain bands with dual-colour mix |
  | Starfield | Eight-layer parallax warp; direction + glow + speed (warp-speed reads as warp-speed) |
  | Noise | Colourable TV-static; haunted-screen, magical-interference, retro-CRT |
  | Make Transparent *(v2.13)* | Punches alpha holes through the map so the active **Backdrop** shows through — magical view-throughs, glass floors, aurora bleed-through |

  Each kind has its own tuning popover (intensity, scale, speed, colours, plus kind-specific knobs). Paint with click-polygon, brush, or magic-wand fill. The same polygon can be repurposed mid-session by switching its kind from the dropdown.

- **Animated backdrops** *(new in v2.12, see-through in v2.13)* — every backdrop-suitable MapFX kind also runs as a full-screen animated backdrop filling the letterbox / pillarbox bars around the map. Pick **Aurora** for sky-themed maps, **Ocean** for a ship floorplan with sea around the deck, **Firestorm** for siege scenes, **Thundercloud** for storms, **Noise** for cursed-tech, etc. The bars are calibrated dead space on tabletop projection setups, so backdrops add immersion without ever overlaying the map itself. **v2.13:** a Make-Transparent MapFX patch on any image map (or a transparent textmap handout) lets the backdrop show through painted regions — so the starfield shines through a constellation chart, the ocean swells behind a ship's deckplan, etc.
- **Visual filters** — full-screen post-processing effects applied to the player view only:

  | Filter | Style |
  |---|---|
  | None | Unfiltered (with optional invert) |
  | Ballpoint Pen | Hand-sketched ink drawing |
  | Hand Drawing | Hatched cross-hatch with halftone colour |
  | Oil Painting | Painterly impasto brush strokes |
  | Parchment Fantasy | Aged sepia parchment with candlelight |
  | Retro Sci-Fi Amber | Warm amber-phosphor CRT terminal |
  | Retro Sci-Fi Green | Classic green-phosphor CRT terminal |
  | Watercolour | Soft watercolour wash |

  Alongside these stylised looks is a set of **atmospheric / lighting filters** — Night Vision, Thermal, Candlelight, Dawn / Dusk, Horror, Mist, Underwater, Sandstorm, weather looks, and more — for tinting a scene's mood. A per-map **Tint Player Markers** toggle extends the active filter onto the tokens (and in-map video) so they share the scene's look.

- **Map transitions** — animated transitions when switching maps on the player view. Select per-map from the GM's Current Map panel:

  | Transition | Description |
  |---|---|
  | None | Instant cut (default) |
  | Fade | Fades to black, swaps map, fades back in |
  | CRT Collapse | Screen collapses to a phosphor dot then expands with the new map |
  | Wipe | Directional wipe (6 directions) with a bright edge glow |
  | Terminal Clear | 80×25 character-grid wipe with phosphor green flash |
  | Static Dissolve | Randomised block-by-block dissolve with static noise |
  | Blood Splatter | For horror games. Pick any colour, dial lightning intensity 0–100. |

  Transitions are extensible — each lives in its own folder under `src/transitions/definitions/` with its own configurable parameters.

- **GM workspace pan/zoom** *(new in v2.11)* — the GM canvas is now a real workspace. Mouse drag to pan, scroll-wheel to zoom around the cursor, arrow keys to nudge, R to reset. Two-finger pinch + drag on touch. A small "Reset view" pill appears at the bottom-right whenever the camera is off identity. Off-screen indicator pills appear at the wrapper edge when a viewport rectangle is panned out of view — click to recentre.
- **Markers / tokens** — place and manage tokens on the map from the Markers panel:
  - **Add** — click **+ Add Marker** in the sidebar or right-click the map.
  - **Direct manipulation** — every marker carries on-canvas chrome when selected: a move handle at the top-left, a row of action badges along the top (visibility / audio role / motion role), and resize + rotate handles. Drag the move handle to reposition; click badges to toggle state.
  - **Properties** — edit name, icon, colour, and size per marker.
  - **Icon picker** — click the icon button to open a grid of 46 preset Unicode symbols (shapes, chess/card suits, circled numbers ①–⑳, check/cross marks). Upload your own custom icon (resized to 64×64 and saved to IndexedDB); custom icons are included in bundle export/import and transmitted to connected players automatically. Use **✕ Delete custom icon** to remove any uploaded icon from the picker.
  - **Clone** — **Clone Marker** duplicates the selected marker (offset slightly, label gets " - copy"), useful for quickly placing groups of identical tokens.
  - **Show Name** — per-marker toggle to display the label on the player map (off by default — players see the icon only unless enabled).
  - **Visibility** — toggle **Hide from players** to ghost the marker on the GM canvas while hiding it from players entirely.
  - **GM badges** — each marker on the GM canvas shows clickable mini-badges for visibility, audio role (source/listener), and motion role (source/tracker). Sources are blue, listener/tracker are green, muted versions are red/purple respectively.
  - **Filter passthrough** — player markers live inside the Three.js scene, so all active GLSL filters (parchment, retro sci-fi, watercolour, etc.) apply to them exactly as to the map.
  - **Persistence** — markers are saved per-map in IndexedDB and restored on reload.
  - **Multi-role markers** — the same marker can simultaneously hold an audio role *and* a motion role (e.g. a creature that emits an ambient howl AND pings the motion tracker).
  - **Marker audio (positional)** — assign an audio role to any marker:
    - **Audio Source** — plays a sound (loop, random, or one-shot) whose volume attenuates with distance to the Listener. Assign a sound from your library, set volume, max-distance radius, and playback mode. Multiple sources are supported.
    - **Listener** — represents the players' ears. Move the listener marker to change what the players hear from each source in real time.
    - All positional audio is broadcast to connected players via P2P.
  - **Motion Tracker** — periodic radar / sonar / sensor sweep. Pick one marker as **Motion Tracker** and one or more as **Motion Source**. Every few seconds the tracker fires an outgoing ping; an expanding ring sweeps from the tracker, and as it crosses each source it fires a return blob + return ping at that exact moment. Configure range (logarithmic slider, 0.05–4.0 of map height), ping rate (0.25–15 s), scan speed, colour, and per-source blob style (single / multi-few / multi-many). Works for _Aliens_-style motion sensors, submarine sonar, sci-fi sensor sweeps, magical scrying — any "I'm here" pulse mechanic. Two CC0 ping sounds are bundled by default. Works through visual filters on the player view.

- **Player Voice** *(new in v2.17)* — players stop being a passive audience and get a voice at the table:
  - **Named, persistent players** — each player introduces themselves once (name + colour); the GM gets a live roster, and identities survive reconnects. The GM can also add an "offline" player to act for someone with no device.
  - **Player tokens** — the GM places a token for any player; with *Let players move their own token* on, that player drags their own token from their device (GM sees it move live, with a one-click "send it back").
  - **Pings** — a player right-clicks / long-presses the map to ping a point; everyone sees a pulse in that player's colour, labelled with their name on the GM screen.
  - **Messaging** — players message the GM privately, or each other (copied to the GM). Threads live in the Player Voice panel with an unread count.
  - **Reply Assistant (optional LLM)** — point Mappadux at a local LM Studio server (no key) or a hosted provider like OpenRouter (key + model) and it drafts in-character reply suggestions; click *Suggest replies*, pick one to send. Stays between your browser and the endpoint you choose.
  - **Initiative tracker** — a fanned-deck initiative rail: roll for the table, drag to reorder, advance turns, ROUND END marker between rounds. Sort high→low (d20) or low→high (roll-under systems).
- **GM annotations** *(new in v2.17)* — drop **progress clocks** (Blades-style), **countdown timers / stopwatches**, a freehand **whiteboard**, and sticky **notes** onto the map. Each is anchored 1:1 to the map and mirrored live to players + projector; saved with the map and travels in the pack.
- **Player Views panel** *(was "Scaled View", v2.17)* — one panel for everything player-facing, with two collapsible sections:
  - **Player connections** — a join QR (uses your LAN IP so any device on the network can open the player view) plus a summary of connected windows: local / scaled / remote, split PC vs mobile.
  - **Scaled view (battlemap mode)** — render a calibrated crop of the map at true table scale on an under-table screen or down-projector, so a 1″ creature projects as 1″ and miniatures occupy real-world inches. Calibrate the map (1″ / 25 mm squares) and the projector device once; the whole flow then runs from a single dropdown — pan to move, optional 1″ grid overlay, rotation for portrait maps, mirror to bezel-framed monitor windows. See [HELP.md](./HELP.md#player-views) for the workflow.
  - A **broadcast toggle** in the panel header swaps the player + projector views for a friendly "the GM is faffing" placeholder while you reset mid-scene (late joiners see it too).
- **Player view control** — an orange rectangle on the GM's canvas always shows what players see. Direct-manipulation chrome: a move handle at the top-left, resize handle at the bottom-right, plus **aspect-lock (16:9)** and **maximise / restore** buttons on the right edge when selected. The player's screen is strictly clipped to the rectangle; background colour fills any bars from aspect-ratio differences. **Show Player View** *(replaces "Open Player Window")* puts an inline preview of the player view right on the GM canvas — pop it out to a full standalone window when you want it on a second screen.
- **Background colour** — set the letterbox colour; auto-sampled from the map on first load.
- **Real-time sync** — all GM changes (map, fog, filter, view, markers, audio, transition) push to connected players instantly.
- **Room code** — three-word memorable code persists across reloads so players can reconnect. If the connection drops, the player window auto-reconnects with exponential back-off.
- **QR code** — scan to open the player view on a phone or tablet instantly. When running locally, uses your LAN IP so other devices on the same network can connect.
- **Soundboard** — play ambient audio and sound effects to connected players from the Soundboard panel:
  - Up to 8 configurable slots per page, with unlimited pages.
  - **Assign sounds** — click any slot to open the sound picker:
    - **My Library** — browse and manage previously saved sounds. Each row shows source / store-state tag pills (`Freesound`, `URL`, `Stored`), an `[!]` chip on assets no map references, an inline editor for licence + attribution + link on user-added rows, and Store / Use / Delete buttons. Footer adds bulk **Store All Used** / **Store All** / **Delete All Unused** plus an **ℹ Attributions & Licences** button that opens a unified credits modal with one-click **Copy All** for both audio + map assets.
    - **Freesound Search** — search [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) by keyword with optional duration filter. Preview before importing. Results paginate with a **More results…** button. Requires a free Freesound API key (paste it into the search tab — it's saved to your browser). Imported sounds are URL-style by default — click **Store** in the library to make them offline-usable and bundle-portable.
    - **Web Links** — paste comma / newline / space delimited URLs to audio files. Each is validated and added to your library tagged `URL`; the file streams from the source at runtime. Click **Store** to take a copy offline.
    - **Upload** — drag and drop any local audio file, or click to browse. Uploaded sounds are stored in IndexedDB and embedded in your bundle export.
  - **Playback modes** — two toggles per slot, combinable:
    - **Loop** 🔄 — plays continuously until stopped; auto-resumes when you return to the map.
    - **Random** 🎲 — fires one-shot plays at randomised intervals. A frequency slider sets the target rate (1–100 plays per 10 minutes); the actual timing is randomised around that target so the soundscape never feels mechanical. Works like a simulated GM pressing play at the right moment. Both loop and random state persist across map switches.
  - **Volume** — per-slot volume slider.
  - **Per-map loop persistence** — looping sounds that were playing when you left a map auto-resume when you return to it.
  - **Broadcast to players** — toggle whether audio is sent to connected players (on by default). Turning it off leaves your local preview unaffected.
  - **Mute all** — silences all audio on the GM side instantly without stopping playback state.
  - **Player mute** — players can right-click the player screen at any time to toggle their own audio mute. A badge indicator (🔇 / 🔊) confirms the action.
  - **Attributions** — the ℹ Attributions button lists all CC-BY sounds currently in use, with full credit text ready to copy.
  - **Preloading** — all sounds assigned to a map are cached on the player client when the map loads, so playback starts instantly with no buffering delay.

- **Soundtracks** *(new in v2.16)* — pack-level background music that persists across map switches, distinct from the Soundboard's per-map effects. YouTube and Spotify both supported:
  - **YouTube / YouTube Music** — no sign-in for the user; IFrame Player handles playback. Single tracks AND playlists / albums.
  - **Spotify** — full programmatic control via the Web Playback SDK + Web API. Requires a Premium account (Free accounts can't stream through the SDK) and a one-time Spotify Developer App registration (step-by-step in Settings).
  - **N user-defined slots**, with a Silence anchor that crossfades to nothing. Each slot holds a single track or a full playlist / album; switching slots crossfades.
  - **Loop / Shuffle / Restart-vs-Resume** per slot. Shuffled playlists start on a random track (not always track 0) and resume **track-stably** — Mappadux replays the exact track you were on at the saved position, then hands off to the shuffled playlist.
  - **Start / End trim** for single tracks — click the "Start" / "End" label while playing to grab the current playhead; click anywhere on the progress bar to seek. End trim is actively enforced so a clip loops or stops cleanly at your chosen point.
  - **External transport awareness** — pausing via a Bluetooth remote, OS media keys, or lock-screen flips the panel's pause icon so the GM can resume from either side.
  - Track URLs travel with `.mappadux` bundles; Spotify tokens and YouTube state stay on this machine.

- **Text Maps (handouts)** *(new in v2.11)* — a second map type for letters, posters, journal pages, stat blocks, in-fiction documents. Rich element editor with text, image, **and live YouTube video** *(v2.17)* elements, font picker, multiple aspect presets, per-element move / resize / rotate, and an optional animated reveal so the handout types itself out for the players. **In-map video** is borderless and GM-controlled: the GM's play / pause / seek / volume drives the player + projector copies (which follow within ~½ s), and active visual filters tint it. Desktop viewers only — mobile video is a documented limitation.

- **Image Assets Library** *(new in v2.11)* — a third first-class asset library alongside Maps and Sounds. Marker icons + handout images live here with the same Library / Web Links / Upload taxonomy as audio, plus built-in connectors for **Lucide** (~1500 MIT-licensed icons) and **game-icons.net** (~4000 CC-BY 3.0 fantasy / sci-fi / abstract icons). Attribution flows through the unified credits modal.

- **Composite Maps** *(new in v2.15)* — combine multiple map images into a single playable map. Two flavours, mix-and-match in the same composite:
  - **Modular** — tile maps side-by-side (towns, dungeon corridors, overland regions). Drop tiles onto the canvas, drag to position, snap to a master grid so cells line up across tiles.
  - **Layered** — stack tiles for roof-over-interior, illusion-over-chamber, before-and-after reveals. When two tiles are the same dimensions, dragging the upper one magnetically snaps to the lower one's centre for pixel-perfect alignment.
  - **Per-tile controls** — rotate (with snap to 90 / 45 / 30 degree angles), resize with optional aspect lock, flip horizontally / vertically, reset to original scale. Right-click any tile for Bring to Front / Forward / Backward / Send to Back, plus **Duplicate Tile** (cheap clone — same image asset, no extra storage).
  - **Reveal Map Layer** MapFX brush — on a layered composite, paint to expose the tile directly underneath rather than the backdrop. The GM canvas previews the reveal as you paint; a slider above the map fades the top tile globally for inspection without painting.
  - **Undo / Redo** — toolbar buttons inside the editor (and Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) walk back through any change you've made this session. Stack clears when you close the editor — no lingering history.
  - **The Library knows** — composites get a purple **Composite** pill; layered composites (with overlapping tiles) get an additional cyan **Layered** pill, signalling that the Reveal Map Layer brush is meaningful here.

- **Bundle import/export** — save and restore your entire pack as a single `.json` file. **Stored** assets (uploads + anything you've explicitly Stored) travel with their blobs and work offline on the recipient. **URL** assets travel as references only and re-fetch on first use, keeping bundle size small.
- **Open New Instance** *(new in v2.15)* — Hamburger → **Open New Instance** opens a fresh, independent Mappadux in a new browser tab with its own library and its own room. Use it to split the party across two GM screens (each with its own player connections), or to keep handouts on one tab + battlemaps on the other, or to experiment without touching your live pack. The two instances don't sync — **Save Map Pack…** from one tab and **Load Map Pack** in the other if you want the same pack in both.
- **Auto-save** — all per-map settings (fog polygons, filter, view position, background colour) save automatically to browser IndexedDB.
- **PWA support** — installable as an app on desktop and mobile.
- **GPU-efficient rendering** — static filters render only on change; animated filters run at full frame rate only when needed.

## Setup & Development

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (GM view: http://localhost:5173 — Player view: http://localhost:5173/player)
npm run dev

# Type-check
npm run typecheck

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The app builds to a static `dist/` folder and can be deployed anywhere that serves static files.

**Vercel** (recommended — `vercel.json` is already configured):
```bash
vercel deploy
```

The `vercel.json` rewrites `/player` to `player.html`. For other hosts, ensure `/player` resolves to `player.html`.

> **COOP / COEP headers**: earlier versions set these for SharedArrayBuffer eligibility. They were removed in v2.15.25 because `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless` blocks YouTube IFrame Player initialisation. SharedArrayBuffer is not used anywhere in Mappadux. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the threat-model write-up.

## Usage

1. **GM view** — open the root URL (e.g. `https://your-deployment.vercel.app/`).
   - Add maps via **+ Add New Map…** (Library / Web Links / Upload).
   - Share the room code or scan the join QR in **Player Views → Player connections**, or use **Show Player View** for an inline preview you can pop out to a local second screen.
   - Draw fog polygons, choose a filter, set a transition, and adjust the player view.
   - Add markers via the Markers panel or by right-clicking the map; drag to reposition.
   - Use the Soundboard panel to play ambient sound and effects to players.
   - Use **☰ → Save Map Pack…** to back up your whole pack (maps, audio, custom icons, fog, markers, splash, theme) as a single `.mappadux` file; **☰ → Load Map Pack** to restore it.

2. **Player view** — open `<your URL>/player`, enter the room code, and connect.
   - The player sees whatever the GM is showing — filtered, cropped, and transitioned as the GM sets it — and can ping, message, move their own token, and roll initiative if the GM allows it.

3. **Scaled view (battlemap mode, optional)** — for in-person play. From **Player Views → Scaled view**: calibrate the projector once (modal opens in its own window — drag onto the projector display and ruler it in), then pick the saved calibration to launch a true-table-scale projector window. Full walkthrough in [HELP.md](./HELP.md#player-views).

## Default Maps

To pre-load maps for first-time users, export your pack from the GM view (**☰ → Save Map Pack…**) and save the resulting file as:

```
public/default-bundle.json
```

The app imports this bundle automatically the first time a user opens it with an empty library. Existing users with saved maps are unaffected.

## Known Limitations

- **Browser storage** — maps are stored in IndexedDB. Clearing browser data will delete them. Export a bundle regularly as a backup.
- **PeerJS relay** — connections go through the public PeerJS broker by default. On restricted networks a self-hosted PeerJS server may be needed.
- **Single GM** — the session model assumes one GM and any number of read-only players.

For more detail on caveats and workarounds, see [docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md](./docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md). [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) has the release history.

### Prior Work

This project was inspired by the Tannhauser Remote Desktop created by the [Quadra](https://www.quadragames.com/) team for their *Warped Beyond Recognition* adventure — a fantastic example of using technology to enhance the tabletop experience.

### Development

This project was built with the assistance of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) by Anthropic. The original v1 was built with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. Both the code and the project are offered freely — use it for whatever you like.
