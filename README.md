No account needed. No server. Everything stays on your device — maps you upload are stored in your browser's local storage and never sent anywhere. Just open the link and go.

## Description

Dynamic Map Renderer v2 is a free, browser-based tool that brings the tools people love about online VTTs into in-person tabletop play. **VTT@Home** in spirit: all the dynamic map, fog, lighting, and audio capabilities you'd use in Roll20 or Foundry, but designed to sit beside the table — on a laptop, second screen, or projected onto the gaming surface — without dragging the GM out of the moment.

The design principles are **immersive, lightweight, and simple**. Setup takes minutes. Using it during a session is non-invasive: you're not navigating menus while your players wait, you're flicking a switch and turning back to the table. It is also designed as a **free community distribution platform** — map creators can package an entire session (maps, fog, markers, audio, transitions) into a single bundle file and share it with their group, their Patreon backers, or the wider community.

Players connect via a peer-to-peer link; no server infrastructure is required beyond static file hosting. Everything stays on your device — maps you upload are stored in your browser's local storage and never sent anywhere.

## Features

- **Map library** — upload `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp` map images; store and switch between them.
- **Fog of War** — draw arbitrary polygons to hide areas from players; click to select and delete.
- **Visual filters** — full-screen post-processing effects applied to the player view only:

  | Filter | Style |
  |---|---|
  | None | Unfiltered (with optional invert) |
  | Ballpoint Pen | Hand-sketched ink drawing |
  | Hand Drawing | Hatched cross-hatch with halftone colour |
  | Oil Painting | Painterly impasto brush strokes |
  | Parchment Fantasy | Aged sepia parchment with candlelight |
  | Retro Sci-Fi Amber | Warm amber-phosphor CRT terminal |
  | Retro Sci-Fi Green | Classic green-phosphor CRT terminal |
  | Watercolour | Soft watercolour wash |

- **Map transitions** — animated transitions when switching maps on the player view. Select per-map from the GM's Current Map panel:

  | Transition | Description |
  |---|---|
  | None | Instant cut (default) |
  | Fade | Fades to black, swaps map, fades back in |
  | CRT Collapse | Screen collapses to a phosphor dot then expands with the new map |
  | Wipe | Directional wipe (6 directions) with a bright edge glow |
  | Terminal Clear | 80×25 character-grid wipe with phosphor green flash |
  | Static Dissolve | Randomised block-by-block dissolve with static noise |

  Transitions are extensible — each lives in its own folder under `src/transitions/definitions/` with its own configurable parameters.

- **Markers / tokens** — place and manage tokens on the map from the Markers panel:
  - **Add** — click **+ Add Marker** in the sidebar or right-click the map.
  - **Drag** — drag any marker to reposition it; position broadcasts to players on release.
  - **Properties** — edit name, icon, colour, and size per marker.
  - **Icon picker** — click the icon button to open a grid of 46 preset Unicode symbols (shapes, chess/card suits, circled numbers ①–⑳, check/cross marks). Upload your own custom icon (resized to 64×64 and saved to IndexedDB); custom icons are included in bundle export/import and transmitted to connected players automatically. Use **✕ Delete custom icon** to remove any uploaded icon from the picker.
  - **Clone** — **Clone Marker** duplicates the selected marker (offset slightly, label gets " - copy"), useful for quickly placing groups of identical tokens.
  - **Show Name** — per-marker toggle to display the label on the player map (off by default — players see the icon only unless enabled).
  - **Visibility** — toggle **Hide from players** to ghost the marker on the GM canvas while hiding it from players entirely.
  - **GM badges** — each marker on the GM canvas shows clickable mini-badges for visibility and role (audio source / listener).
  - **Filter passthrough** — player markers live inside the Three.js scene, so all active GLSL filters (parchment, retro sci-fi, watercolour, etc.) apply to them exactly as to the map.
  - **Persistence** — markers are saved per-map in IndexedDB and restored on reload.
  - **Marker audio (positional)** — assign an audio role to any marker:
    - **Audio Source** — plays a sound (loop, random, or one-shot) whose volume attenuates with distance to the Listener. Assign a sound from your library, set volume, max-distance radius, and playback mode. Multiple sources are supported.
    - **Listener** — represents the players' ears. Move the listener marker to change what the players hear from each source in real time.
    - All positional audio is broadcast to connected players via P2P.

- **Player view control** — interactive on-map viewport editor: an orange rectangle on the GM's canvas always shows what players see. Click **Edit Player View** to drag-move or freely corner-resize it. One-click **Reset to Full Map**. The player's screen is strictly clipped to the rectangle; background colour fills any bars caused by aspect-ratio differences.
- **Background colour** — set the letterbox colour; auto-sampled from the map on first load.
- **Real-time sync** — all GM changes (map, fog, filter, view, markers, audio, transition) push to connected players instantly.
- **Room code** — three-word memorable code persists across reloads so players can reconnect. If the connection drops, the player window auto-reconnects with exponential back-off.
- **QR code** — scan to open the player view on a phone or tablet instantly. When running locally, uses your LAN IP so other devices on the same network can connect.
- **Soundboard** — play ambient audio and sound effects to connected players from the Soundboard panel:
  - Up to 8 configurable slots per page, with unlimited pages.
  - **Assign sounds** — click any slot to open the sound picker:
    - **My Library** — browse and manage previously saved sounds; filter by name.
    - **Freesound Search** — search [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) by keyword with optional duration filter. Preview before importing. Results paginate with a **More results…** button. Requires a free Freesound API key (paste it into the search tab — it's saved to your browser).
    - **Upload** — drag and drop any local audio file, or click to browse. Uploaded sounds are stored in IndexedDB and embedded in your bundle export.
  - **Playback modes** — two toggles per slot, combinable:
    - **Loop** 🔄 — plays continuously until stopped; auto-resumes when you return to the map.
    - **Random** 🎲 — fires one-shot plays at randomised intervals. A frequency slider sets the target rate (1–100 plays per 10 minutes); the actual timing is randomised around that target so the soundscape never feels mechanical. Works like a simulated GM pressing play at the right moment. Both loop and random state persist across map switches.
  - **Volume** — per-slot volume slider.
  - **Per-map loop persistence** — looping sounds that were playing when you left a map auto-resume when you return to it.
  - **Broadcast to players** — toggle whether audio is sent to connected players (on by default). Turning it off leaves your local preview unaffected.
  - **Mute all** — silences all audio on the GM side instantly without stopping playback state.
  - **Player mute** — players can right-click the player screen at any time to toggle their own audio mute. A badge indicator (🔇 / 🔊) confirms the action.
  - **Attributions** — the ℹ Attributions button lists all CC-BY sounds currently in use, with full credit text ready to copy.
  - **Preloading** — all sounds assigned to a map are cached on the player client when the map loads, so playback starts instantly with no buffering delay.

- **Bundle import/export** — save and restore your entire map library (images, fog, filter settings, and uploaded audio files) as a single `.json` file.
- **Auto-save** — all per-map settings (fog polygons, filter, view position, background colour) save automatically to browser IndexedDB.
- **PWA support** — installable as an app on desktop and mobile.
- **GPU-efficient rendering** — static filters render only on change; animated filters run at full frame rate only when needed.

## Setup & Development

Requires Node.js 18+.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (GM view: http://localhost:5173 — Player view: http://localhost:5173/player)
npm run dev

# Type-check
npm run typecheck

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The app builds to a static `dist/` folder and can be deployed anywhere that serves static files.

**Vercel** (recommended — `vercel.json` is already configured):
```bash
vercel deploy
```

The `vercel.json` sets the required `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` headers (needed for WebRTC) and rewrites `/player` to `player.html`.

For other hosts, ensure those two COOP/COEP headers are set on all responses, and that `/player` resolves to `player.html`.

## Usage

1. **GM view** — open the root URL (e.g. `https://your-deployment.vercel.app/`).
   - Upload maps with **Upload New Map**.
   - Share the room code or QR code with players, or click **Open Player Window** for a local second screen.
   - Draw fog polygons, choose a filter, set a transition, and adjust the player view.
   - Add markers via the Markers panel or by right-clicking the map; drag to reposition.
   - Use the Soundboard panel to play ambient sound and effects to players.
   - Use **Save to File** to back up your map library (including custom icons and uploaded audio); **Load Maps File** to restore it.

2. **Player view** — open `<your URL>/player`, enter the room code, and connect.
   - The player sees whatever the GM is showing, filtered, cropped, and transitioned as the GM sets it.

## Default Maps

To pre-load maps for first-time users, export your map library from the GM view (**Save to File**) and save the resulting file as:

```
public/default-bundle.json
```

The app imports this bundle automatically the first time a user opens it with an empty library. Existing users with saved maps are unaffected.

## Known Limitations

- **Browser storage** — maps are stored in IndexedDB. Clearing browser data will delete them. Export a bundle regularly as a backup.
- **PeerJS relay** — connections go through the public PeerJS broker by default. On restricted networks a self-hosted PeerJS server may be needed.
- **Single GM** — the session model assumes one GM and any number of read-only players.

## Future Plans

1. **Lighting** — dynamic light radius effects around tokens.

### Prior Work

This project was inspired by the Tannhauser Remote Desktop created by the [Quadra](https://www.quadragames.com/) team for their *Warped Beyond Recognition* adventure — a fantastic example of using technology to enhance the tabletop experience.

### Development

This project was built with the assistance of [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) by Anthropic. The original v1 was built with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. Both the code and the project are offered freely — use it for whatever you like.
