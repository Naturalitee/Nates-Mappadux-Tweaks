# Changelog

## v2.6.0 — 2026-05-07

### New Features

- **Marker audio — positional audio sources** — markers can now be assigned a role of _Audio Source_ or _Listener_. Audio Sources play a looping or randomised sound whose volume falls off with distance to the Listener marker. The listener position is determined by another marker set to the Listener role (typically the player character). Volume falloff is calculated in real time as either marker is dragged.
  - **Assign sound** — click the new "Assign Sound" button in the marker properties panel to pick any sound from My Library.
  - **Playback modes** — Once / Loop / Random (same scheduler as the Soundboard).
  - **Volume** — per-source volume slider and a per-role mute toggle.
  - **Max distance** — configurable radius slider beyond which the source is inaudible.
  - **Preloading** — all audio-source buffers for the current map are preloaded on map load so positional audio starts immediately.
  - **P2P broadcast** — `positional_play` / `positional_stop` / `positional_volume` messages keep player-side audio in sync as markers move.
- **Clone Marker** — a **Clone Marker** button sits alongside Delete Marker. Creates an exact copy of the selected marker offset by +0.02 in both axes, with " - copy" appended to the label. Useful for quickly placing groups of identical tokens.
- **Player auto-reconnect** — if the GM refreshes or the P2P connection drops, the player window automatically attempts to reconnect with exponential back-off (2 s → 4 s → 8 s → 16 s → 30 s cap). The status bar shows "Reconnecting… (Ns, attempt N)" while retrying.
- **Freesound pagination** — search results now show a **More results… (N remaining)** button when the API returns more than one page. Each click appends the next batch of 20 without clearing the existing results. The status line tracks how many are shown vs total.
- **Delete custom icon** — a **✕ Delete custom icon** button appears below **+ Upload custom icon** in the icon picker when custom icons exist. Clicking it enters delete mode (icons turn red-bordered); clicking any custom icon removes it from IndexedDB and the in-memory cache. **← Cancel delete** exits without removing anything.

### Fixes

- **Bundle import state clobber** — importing a bundle file (`Load Maps File`) no longer discards the freshly-imported per-map configs. Previously, `loadMap` flushed the old in-memory session state to IDB after the import wrote fresh configs with the same map IDs — silently overwriting markers, audio slots, and player view with stale data. Fixed by calling `StateManager.resetForImport()` before repopulating the map list, ensuring the flush in `loadMap` is a no-op.
- **Soundboard slot/audio restore** — discrete state mutations (markers, audio, transitions) now trigger an immediate IDB write rather than waiting for the 400 ms debounce. This closes the window where a page refresh could occur before the debounced write fired and wipe the last change.

## v2.5.0 — 2026-05-06

### New Features
- **Soundboard** — each map now has a per-map Soundboard panel (between Fog of War and Markers). Add up to 10 slots per page (pageable for more). Each slot has a play/stop button, loop toggle, individual volume slider, and a remove button.
- **Freesound integration** — search Freesound.org directly from the app (requires a free API key, stored in `localStorage` only — never exported). Results show duration, username, and license. Duration filter dropdown: ≤10s / ≤20s / ≤30s (default) / ≤60s / ≤120s / Any length. Preview before importing.
- **Sound library** — imported sounds are stored in IndexedDB and shared across all maps. The "My Library" tab in the picker lets you reuse any previously imported sound on any map with one click.
- **Attribution tracking** — the "ℹ Attributions" button in the Soundboard panel lists all Freesound attribution strings and license labels so CC-BY compliance is always accessible.
- **Broadcast to players** — soundboard play/stop events are sent over P2P so players hear audio in real time. A "Broadcast to players" toggle in the panel silences remote delivery for in-person play.
- **Auto-reload** — if a sound blob is missing from local storage, the engine silently re-downloads it from Freesound before flagging the slot as unavailable.
- **Player autoplay recovery** — if the browser blocks autoplay, a "Click anywhere to enable audio" hint appears on the player screen and retries on the next interaction.
- **P2P snapshot** — currently-playing slots travel in `full_state` and `map_change` so players who connect mid-session hear what's already playing.

---

## v2.4.0 — 2026-05-05

### Changes
- **Sidebar panel order** — Fog of War → Markers → Player View → Filter → Background Colour.
- **Panel headings** — brighter text, bolder weight, subtle blue-tinted background; hover lifts to full white. Makes sections easier to scan.
- **Auto-open Markers panel** — clicking any marker on the canvas opens the Markers sidebar panel if it is collapsed.
- **Auto-open Fog panel** — entering fog draw mode or selecting a polygon opens the Fog of War panel if it is collapsed.

---

## v2.3.5 — 2026-05-05

### Fixes
- **Markers on map change** — switching maps now sends the new map's markers (and any custom icon blobs) atomically inside `map_change`, the same way fog/filter/view already travel. Previously `marker_update` was never broadcast on a map switch, so players kept the previous map's markers until a manual drag triggered a sync.

---

## v2.3.4 — 2026-05-05

### Changes
- **Custom icons sent to players** — custom uploaded icons are now transmitted over P2P. The GM encodes each referenced `asset:uuid` icon to a data URL and includes it in `marker_update` and `full_state` messages; the player decodes each entry to an `ImageBitmap` and caches it by key, skipping any already cached. This mirrors the pattern planned for audio asset delivery.

---

## v2.3.3 — 2026-05-05

### Changes
- **Show Name toggle** — each marker now has a "Show Name on player map" checkbox (default off). When off, the player map shows the icon only; the GM always sees the label regardless of this setting.

---

## v2.3.2 — 2026-05-05

### Fixes
- **Player marker Y-axis** — markers placed at the top of the GM map now appear at the top on the player screen. `MarkerTexture` was applying `(1 − y)` before drawing, which double-inverted the coordinate (Three.js `CanvasTexture` with `flipY=true` already handles the canvas→UV flip). Fixed to `cy = y * H`.

---

## v2.3.1 — 2026-05-05

### Changes
- **Markers subject to filters** — player marker layer moved from a 2D canvas DOM overlay into the Three.js scene as Plane 2 (CanvasTexture), so all GLSL post-processing filters (parchment, retro sci-fi, watercolor, etc.) are applied to markers the same as the map and fog layers.
- **Icon picker** — replaced the free-text icon input with a click-to-open picker grid. Includes 46 preset Unicode symbols (shapes, chess/card suits, circled numbers ①–⑳, check/cross marks). Custom icons can be uploaded (resized to 64×64), are stored in IndexedDB, and are included in map bundle exports/imports for full portability.
- **Icon visual redesign** — removed the filled circle background. Icons now render directly in the marker's chosen colour with a dark stroke outline for readability. Default icon changed from 📍 to ◆. Image icons (custom uploads) use `asset:<uuid>` keys and render as-is.
- **Asset storage** — added `assets` store helpers (`saveAsset`, `getAllAssets`, `deleteAsset`) to the IndexedDB layer. Custom icons (`type: 'icon'`) are included in bundle export/import alongside maps.

## v2.3.0 — 2026-05-05

### New Features
- **Markers / tokens** — GMs can now place, move, and manage tokens on the map.
  - **Add** — click "+ Add Marker" in the sidebar or right-click the map to place a marker at any position.
  - **Drag** — click and drag any marker to reposition it; position is broadcast to players on release.
  - **Select** — click a marker to select it; its properties appear in the Markers sidebar panel.
  - **Sidebar controls** — edit name, icon (emoji), colour, and size. Toggle "Hide from players" to ghost the marker on the GM canvas while hiding it entirely from the player view.
  - **GM status badges** — each marker shows two clickable mini-badges: visibility (green ✓ / red ✕) and a role badge for audio sources (♪) and listeners (◉). Clicking a badge toggles the property directly on the canvas.
  - **HUD buttons** — a floating mini-toolbar above the selected marker offers one-click toggle-visibility and delete.
  - **Marker dropdown** — the sidebar dropdown lists all markers; selecting from it highlights the marker on the canvas.
  - **Player view** — players see all non-hidden markers rendered at their correct map-relative positions regardless of zoom or viewport offset. Markers re-project automatically on view changes.
  - **Persistence** — markers are saved per-map in IndexedDB and restored on reload.
  - **P2P broadcast** — marker changes are broadcast as `marker_update`; hidden markers are filtered out before transmission.

## v2.2.4 — 2026-05-05

### Changes
- **Scanline → Terminal Clear** — redesigned from a simple line sweep to an 80×25 character-grid wipe (configurable 40–160 cols, 10–50 rows). Each cell flashes phosphor green before being cleared, with a multi-cell fade band preceding the clear front. Cleared left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Configurable duration 500ms–6s.
- **Diagonal wipe polygon fix** — corrected vertex ordering for both `diag_tl` and `diag_tr` which previously produced self-crossing polygons and visible artifacts. Full case analysis for all five geometric phases (triangle → landscape quad → portrait quad → pentagon → full fill).
- **Wipe direction labels** — arrows now indicate movement direction (e.g. `→ Left to right`) rather than the start edge.

---

## v2.2.2 — 2026-05-05

### Fixes
- **Wipe / Scanline / Static Dissolve** — transitions were showing the edge glow but removing the whole image at once rather than revealing it progressively. Root cause: `drawEdge` and noise code left `ctx.fillStyle` set to a low-alpha gradient at the end of each frame; `ctx.save()` on the next frame captured that as the active fill, so `destination-out` was painting with near-transparent paint and punching no holes. Fixed by setting `ctx.fillStyle = '#000'` inside every `destination-out` block (`destination-out` ignores colour and uses alpha only).

---

## v2.2.1 — 2026-05-05

### New Features
- **Map transitions** — animated transitions play on the player screen when the GM switches maps. Select the transition (and configure its parameters) from the Current Map panel in the GM view. The transition holds the current view, plays the animation, and reveals the new map — filter, fog, and view all swap atomically so nothing flickers in early.
  - **None** — instant cut (default behaviour, unchanged).
  - **Fade** — fades the current map to black, swaps to the new map, fades back in. Duration configurable.
  - **CRT Collapse** — the screen collapses to a horizontal line, then to a phosphor dot (with green/amber glow), then expands back out with the new map. Colour and timing configurable.
  - **Wipe** — directional wipe in 6 directions (left, right, up, down, diagonal TL, diagonal TR) with a bright edge glow. Duration configurable.
  - **Scanline** — top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top reveal with a green scan-line glow. Duration configurable.
  - **Static Dissolve** — randomised block-by-block dissolve with subtle static noise. Block size and duration configurable.
  - Architecture mirrors the filters system: each transition lives in `src/transitions/definitions/<id>/index.ts` with its own param schema. Adding a new transition is a single new file — no registry edits needed. See `ADDING_TRANSITIONS.md` in the definitions folder.
- **Version badge** — current version shown in small text at the bottom of the GM sidebar.
- **LAN IP in QR code and player links** — when running the dev server locally, the QR code, "Open Player Window" button, and "Copy Player URL" now use the machine's LAN IP address instead of `localhost`. Allows phones and tablets on the same network to connect during local testing. (Production builds are unaffected.)

### Fixes & Improvements
- **Mobile viewport fix** — switched `Renderer` from `window.addEventListener('resize')` to `ResizeObserver`. On Android/Pixel the window resize event never fired on initial layout, causing the player to show the full map instead of the GM-defined viewport rectangle.
- **Atomic map change** — filter, view, and fog state now travel inside the `map_change` message rather than as separate follow-up messages. Eliminates a race where the new filter or view could briefly flash on the old map before the transition ran.
- **Transition reveal correctness** — transitions now snapshot the old frame, load the new map underneath while the snapshot covers the canvas, then animate the snapshot away. This ensures wipe/dissolve/scanline transitions reveal actual new content rather than the old map.

## v2.1.0 — 2026-04-18

### New Features
- **Interactive viewport editor** — the pan/zoom sliders are replaced by a direct on-map editor. A faint orange marching-ants rectangle is permanently overlaid on the GM's map showing exactly what players currently see. Click **Edit Player View** to activate drag handles: move the rectangle by dragging inside it, or resize it freely by dragging any corner. Hit **OK** to commit or **Cancel** to revert.
- **Reset to Full Map** — one-click button to snap the player view back to showing the complete map.
- **Strict viewport clipping** — the player's screen is hard-clipped to the GM's rectangle. No map content outside that rectangle is ever visible regardless of the player's screen size or aspect ratio. Background colour fills any letterbox or pillarbox bars.

---
